# Stroke-Prediction
Predict if patient is likely to have a stroke

However, due to the nature of the data, no individual prediction was greater than a 30% chance of a stroke since a large majority of the patients from the test data did not experience a stroke. Thus, this proves that having a stroke in itself is a rare occurence. So consider 30% chance a high chance for the sake of this model.

# Results

After we trained the ML Model, we used a 3d scatterplot to graph it and attempt to find two variables that together may signify a higher chance of strokes in patients.


Note: The Left will have a picture of our Models predictions while the right will have a picture of the true data.


Here are the results:

1) Age vs BMI

As you can see the older a person got, the more likely it was that they had a stroke.



2) Age vs Average Glucose Levels
