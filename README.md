Your percent likelihood of stroke will be outputed to the screen. However, due to the nature of the data, no individual prediction was greater than a 30% chance of a stroke since a large majority of the patients from the test data did not experience a stroke. Thus, this proves that having a stroke in itself is a rare occurence. So consider 30% chance a high chance for the sake of this model. 

# Results

After we trained the ML Model, we used a 3d scatterplot to graph it and attempt to find two variables that together may signify a higher chance of strokes in patients.

Note: The Left will have a picture of our Models predictions while the right will have a picture of the true data.


Here are the results:

1) Age vs BMI 


As you can see the older a person got, the more likeli it was that they had a stroke. M

2) Age vs Average Glucose Levels




3) BMI vs Average Glucose Levels
